The pressures of society\'s arbitrary formulations of youth, womanhood and the performance of social media fakery, are laid bare with drama, dance, music, and sass. <em><strong>Hertitude </strong></em>brims with attitudes of hard truth, controversial morality, elegance and sassy entertainment in dramatic twists and turns. It is representative of contemporary Nigerian life where new visions, new ways of thinking and a re-imagining of the country is engendered. Our play <em><strong>Hertitude </strong></em>takes the lid off the familiar ba-dum-bum of social life in the city, and, consequently reveals the challenges of being a growing youth and a woman in Nigeria and reveals a society that is at war with itself. &nbsp;In performance, <em><strong>Hertitude </strong></em>fills the space with color, elegance and gut-wrenching honesty; where societal and individual foibles are exposed, even as we celebrate the power of hope and redemptive beauty. <em><strong>Hertitude</strong></em> parades a youthful cast and crew of trained, professional and talented Nigerian youths.</p>","title":"Hertitude ","venue":"Mainland Nigeria","date":"2019-12-14 17:00:00","thumbnail":"https://www.afritickets.com/uploads/events/thumb/70efe422da0baec30bbcaab53af2ce64","original":"https://www.afritickets.com/uploads/events/original/70efe422da0baec30bbcaab53af2ce64","organizerLogo":null,"organizer":null,"ticketCategories":[{"typeId":"7788","price":"5000.00","title":"Jan. 5th: Regular","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7790","price":"5000.00","title":"Jan. 4th: Regular","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7792","price":"5000.00","title":"Jan. 1st: Regular","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7794","price":"5000.00","title":"Dec. 29th: Regular","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7798","price":"5000.00","title":"Dec. 25th: Regular","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7800","price":"5000.00","title":"Dec. 22nd: Regular","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7802","price":"5000.00","title":"Dec. 21st: Regular","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7804","price":"5000.00","title":"Dec. 15th: Regular","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7806","price":"5000.00","title":"Dec. 14th: Regular","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7787","price":"15000.00","title":"Jan. 5th: VIP","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7789","price":"15000.00","title":"Jan. 4th: VIP","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7791","price":"15000.00","title":"Jan. 1st: VIP","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7793","price":"15000.00","title":"Dec. 29th: VIP","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7795","price":"15000.00","title":"Dec. 28th: VIP","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7797","price":"15000.00","title":"Dec. 25th: VIP","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7799","price":"15000.00","title":"Dec. 22nd: VIP","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7801","price":"15000.00","title":"Dec. 21st: VIP","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7803","price":"15000.00","title":"Dec. 15th: VIP","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7805","price":"15000.00","title":"Dec. 14th: VIP","quantity":"0"}]},{"id":"4988","description":"<p>The African Warriors Fighting Championship is the leading promoter of indigenous combat sports.</p>\\n<p>Taking place on the iconic Lekki Leisure Beach, Coronation of Kings will feature knockout tournaments in dambe and wrestling followed by main events showcasing heavyweight champions.</p>\\n<p>Alongside the fighting action, expect traditional music, food and drink.</p>\\n<p>Follow the African Warriors Fighting Championship for the best dambe and wrestling action:</p>\\n<p>Facebook &amp;
