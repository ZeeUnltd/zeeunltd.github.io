It is representative of contemporary Nigerian life where new visions, new ways of thinking and a re-imagining of the country is engendered. Our play <em><strong>Hertitude </strong></em>takes the lid off the familiar ba-dum-bum of social life in the city, and, consequently reveals the challenges of being a growing youth and a woman in Nigeria and reveals a society that is at war with itself. &nbsp;In performance, <em><strong>Hertitude </strong></em>fills the space with color, elegance and gut-wrenching honesty; where societal and individual foibles are exposed, even as we celebrate the power of hope and redemptive beauty. <em><strong>Hertitude</strong></em> parades a youthful cast and crew of trained, professional and talented Nigerian youths.</p>","title":"Hertitude ","venue":"Mainland Nigeria","date":"2019-12-14 17:00:00","thumbnail":"https://www.afritickets.com/uploads/events/thumb/70efe422da0baec30bbcaab53af2ce64","original":"https://www.afritickets.com/uploads/events/original/70efe422da0baec30bbcaab53af2ce64","organizerLogo":null,"organizer":null,"ticketCategories":[{"typeId":"7788","price":"5000.00","title":"Jan. 5th: Regular","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7790","price":"5000.00","title":"Jan. 4th: Regular","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7792","price":"5000.00","title":"Jan. 1st: Regular","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7794","price":"5000.00","title":"Dec. 29th: Regular","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7798","price":"5000.00","title":"Dec. 25th: Regular","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7800","price":"5000.00","title":"Dec. 22nd: Regular","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7802","price":"5000.00","title":"Dec. 21st: Regular","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7804","price":"5000.00","title":"Dec. 15th: Regular","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7806","price":"5000.00","title":"Dec. 14th: Regular","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7787","price":"15000.00","title":"Jan. 5th: VIP","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7789","price":"15000.00","title":"Jan. 4th: VIP","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7791","price":"15000.00","title":"Jan. 1st: VIP","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7793","price":"15000.00","title":"Dec. 29th: VIP","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7795","price":"15000.00","title":"Dec. 28th: VIP","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7797","price":"15000.00","title":"Dec. 25th: VIP","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7799","price":"15000.00","title":"Dec. 22nd: VIP","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7801","price":"15000.00","title":"Dec. 21st: VIP","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7803","price":"15000.00","title":"Dec. 15th: VIP","quantity":"0"},{"typeId":"7805","price":"15000.00","title":"Dec. 14th: VIP","quantity":"0"}]},{"id":"4988","description":"<p>The African Warriors Fighting Championship is the leading promoter of indigenous combat sports.</p>\\n<p>Taking place on the iconic Lekki Leisure Beach, Coronation of Kings will feature knockout tournaments in dambe and wrestling followed by main events showcasing heavyweight champions.</p>\\n<p>Alongside the fighting action, expect traditional music, food and drink.</p>\\n<p>Follow the African Warriors Fighting Championship for the best dambe and wrestling action:</p>\\n<p>Facebook &amp;
